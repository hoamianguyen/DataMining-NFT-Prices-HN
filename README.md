* Dataset original shape: ~1.5M rows and 7 Columns  
## Model Selection
Regression: Multi-linear regression 
```
Strength: 
Simple to implement
Easy to interpret output ( coefficient, correlation)
Weakness:
Sensitive to outliers
Can perform poorly when there are a non-linear relationships
```
Time Series Analysis: Long-short term memory
```
Strength:
Help identify autocorrelation, seasonality, stationarity, patterns 
Weakness:
Poor performance with long-term forecasting, Random Walks and the Non Independence of Observations, Impact of Single Events
Models could be over-fitting, which may leads to inaccurate results
```
